# Robustness and Accuracy Could Be Reconcilable by (Proper) Definition

The code for the ICML 2022 submission **Robustness and Accuracy Could Be Reconcilable by (Proper) Definition** (paper ID 1046).

## Environment settings and libraries we used in our experiments

This project is tested under the following environment settings:
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04.3
- GPU: NVIDIA A100
- Cuda: 11.1, Cudnn: v8.2
- Python: 3.9.5
- PyTorch: 1.8.0
- Torchvision: 0.9.0

## Acknowledgement
The codes are modifed based on [PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/imrahulr/adversarial_robustness_pytorch).
